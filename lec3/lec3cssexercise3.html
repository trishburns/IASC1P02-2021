			<p class="firstclass"> Yoga studios typically don't have mirrors. This is so people can focus their awareness inward rather than how a pose or the people around them looks. Surveys have found that those who practiced yoga were more aware of their bodies than people who didn't practice yoga. They were also more satisfied with and less critical of their bodies. For these reasons, yoga has become an integral part in the treatment of eating disorders and programs that promote positive body image and self-esteem.</p>
