<p id="firstHeader">Having Twins</p>

		<div>
			<p class="greenText">With two children the same age, there is a lot of pressure on parents to keep everything equal. What you do for one, you have to do for the other. You want them to have equal access to resources and opportunities. It can become an exhausting effort, ensuring that everyone gets to take their turn, receives a fair shake and an equal portion.</p>

			<p class="greenText">The twin relationship is unique and complicated. Twins are individuals, but they are also part of a twin dynamic. Parents are charged with raising them as individuals, yet the world wants to see their children as a set. Comparisons and contrasts come from every direction, and parents even have to fight their own instincts not to juxtapose one child's characteristics against the next.</p>
